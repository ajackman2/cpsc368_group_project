# Project Summary

We were generally interested in investigating whether Canadians' relationship with technology has changed with the COVID-19 global pandemic. Specifically, we investigated how daily internet use changed during the pandemic (e.g. 2020-2021) compared to before the pandemic (e.g. 2018) and whether this impact persisted (e.g. 2022).

# Research Questions

1. How has Canadians' daily internet use changed with the prevalence of COVID-19 cases?

We hypothesize that Internet use increased with the prevalence of COVID-19 since Canadians socially isolated during these times and needed the internet for school, work, and socialization.

2. Have any changes in average daily internet use adopted during the pandemic (2020-2021) persisted post-pandemic (2022-2025)?

We hypothesize that some changes have persisted leading to increased internet usage post-pandemic as technologies such as zoom, telemedicine, and remote work have persisted.

3. Are there differences between age groups (e.g. under 15, 15-24, 25-64, 65+)  in how daily internet use has changed?

We hypothesize that there will be differences in the change in daily internet use between age groups as younger groups are likely to already use the internet heavily while older groups may have previously not used the internet much.
